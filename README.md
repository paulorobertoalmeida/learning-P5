# Learning-P5

Its a crazy ride since the moment you decided to learn something new huh? Thats why I'm trying to document my journey and I'll put here every good content I like to be part of this big file. <br>

I decided to start learning P5<br>

p5.js is a JavaScript library for creative coding, with a focus on making coding accessible and inclusive for artists, designers, educators, beginners, and anyone else! p5.js is free and open-source because we believe software, and the tools to learn it, should be accessible to everyone.
